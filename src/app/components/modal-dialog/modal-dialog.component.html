  <h3>Develop across all platforms</h3>
  <p>Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build
    apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.</p>

  <h3>Speed &amp; Performance</h3>
  <p>Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web
    Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge
    data requirements by building data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.</p>

    <p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides
        the Router service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides
        sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>
